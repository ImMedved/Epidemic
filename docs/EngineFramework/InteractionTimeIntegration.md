# InteractionTimeIntegration

Goal 4 block: `b08_integration_adapters`.
Freeze unit: `EngineFramework/IntegrationLayer/InteractionTimeIntegration`.
Admission: 8 public API, 16 mutation obligations, 0 lifecycle, 4 stale-identity, 0 external-boundary candidates.

## Public contract review

- Interaction -> scheduled time binding.
- Cancel interaction removes/invalidates schedule по контракту.
- Trigger after interaction terminal state.
- Duplicate schedule delivery.
- Reconciliation after restore.

## Failure atomicity and accepted-work review

Every local adapter mutation was reviewed for success, invalid input, retry/duplicate behavior, stale identities/cursors and publication ordering. Fallible local bookkeeping must complete before an externally owned side effect is accepted, or a durable reconciliation record must already exist.

## Persistence and reconciliation

The module exposes local snapshot/checkpoint state. Capture/restore validation and continuation are covered by the owned integration test; whole-engine ordered persistence remains Goal 5.

## Test evidence

- Source: `EngineFramework/DevelopmentInfrastructure/Tests/interaction_time_integration_tests.cpp`.
- Target: `EpidemicGameFrameworkInteractionTimeIntegrationTests`.
- Reviewed paths include happy path, invalid/stale input, duplicate/retry behavior and local failure/reconciliation behavior applicable to this module.
- The B08 worker compiled and executed this target under C++23 with Clang warnings-as-errors in the available Linux environment. Required Windows MSVC Debug/Release qualification remains a serial-integration gate.

## Goal 4 result

`LOCAL_READY_CANDIDATE` for block-local evidence. This is not a whole-Framework `LOCAL_READY`, `SYSTEM_READY` or `FROZEN` claim.
